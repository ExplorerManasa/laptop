we are having two types of components in react.
1.Functional component
2.class component

Function component: is used for displaying the data 
				   we dont have the capability to perform the operations until 2016.
				   Then introduced react hooks.

Class component: in which we are going to use arender method.
                 Manipulations are also perfoemed in class components.



Types of calling a component 2ways:
1.<compoent/>
2.<component></component>

Props:Which is for transferring the data fom one component to another component.

STATE:in class compnents we are going to use render method.state is going to work only in class components you nedd to use it as a object.to access  
the state data this.state.variablname is used by us


Set state method helps to update a state variable we are going to use camelCase covention method we are going to get a event as parameter carries target.value
by using arrow method type we handle the function.

JSX Java script extensible. where we write the code in elements format
Css class property is defined using class name(create Element is used without JSX).
